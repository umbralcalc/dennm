# `dennm-torch`: (DEN)sity of (N)on-(M)arkovian phenomena with Libtorch

A generalised density solver for non-Markovian phenomena written in `C++` with the Libtorch API to make it nice and fast.

The computational framework for `dennm-torch` is outlined in the technical documentation which can be read in [this book chapter](https://umbralcalc.github.io/worlds-of-observation/using_the_time_evolution_of_probabilities/chapter.pdf).

# `dennm`: (DEN)sity of (N)on-(M)arkovian phenomena

A generalised density solver for non-Markovian phenomena written in `Rust` and using the `ArrayFire` wrapper ([see here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust)) to make it nice and fast.

The computational framework for `dennm` is outlined in the technical documentation which can be read in the `docs/` folder.

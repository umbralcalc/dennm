# `dennm`: (DEN)sity of (N)on-(M)arkovian phenomena

The computational framework for `dennm` is derived using the formalism from the publicly-available book: [Diffusing Ideas](https://umbralcalc.github.io/diffusing-ideas/). Let's begin by writing the generalised non-Markovian master equation for stochastic phenomena which was given in [this chapter](https://umbralcalc.github.io/diffusing-ideas/empirical_probabilistic_reweighting/chapter.pdf) of the book

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{{\sf t}+1}(x\vert z) &= \int_{\Omega_{{\sf t}}}{\rm d}X' P_{{\sf t}+1}(X\vert z) = \int_{\Omega_{{\sf t}}}{\rm d}X' P_{{\sf t}}(X'\vert z) P_{({\sf t}+1){\sf t}}(x\vert X',z) .
\end{aligned}
$$

For now, let's imagine that $x$ is just a scalar (as opposed to a row vector) for simplicity in the expressions. We can then write down a kind of Kramers-Moyal expansion of the equation above

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{{\sf t}+1}(x\vert z) = \int_{\Omega_{{\sf t}}}{\rm d}X' P_{{\sf t}}(X'\vert z) \bigg[ \delta (x-x') &+ \sum^{{\sf t}}_{{\sf t}'=0}\partial_x\delta (x-x')[\mu_1]_{{\sf t}'}(X'',z) \\
&+ \sum^{{\sf t}}_{{\sf t}'=0}\partial_x\delta (x-x')\sum^{{\sf t}'}_{{\sf t}''=0}\partial_{x}\delta (x-x'')[\mu_2]_{{\sf t}'{\sf t}''}(X'',z) \dots \bigg] ,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\partial_x\delta$ in some sense denotes the formal derivative of a Dirac delta function and the $\mu_i$ terms denote the $i$-th conditional moments with respect to the distribution over $x$ at all of the previous timesteps (which are indicated by the timestep indices).

Truncating the expansion terms up to second order results in the following difference equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{{\sf t}+1}(x\vert z) - P_{{\sf t}}(x\vert z) \simeq &-\sum^{{\sf t}}_{{\sf t}'=0}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bigg\lbrace P_{{\sf t}'}(X\vert z)[\mu_1]_{{\sf t}'}(X,z) \bigg\rbrace \bigg\vert_{X_{{\sf t}'}=x} \\
&+\sum^{{\sf t}}_{{\sf t}'=0}\sum^{{\sf t}'}_{{\sf t}''=0}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\bigg\lbrace P_{{\sf t}'}(X\vert z)[\mu_2]_{{\sf t}'{\sf t}''}(X,z) \bigg\rbrace \bigg\vert_{X_{{\sf t}'}=x \,\wedge\, X_{{\sf t}''}=x} .
\end{aligned}
$$
